# NewRepoDemo
this is the project where we this 
Instructions:
1.	Code should be well-documented and follow best practices.
2.	Each task should be implemented in a separate Java class.

Sales Analysis for Retail Store

•	Private instance variables: sales (an array of double values representing daily sales).
•	Public methods:
•	addSale(double saleAmount): Adds a daily sale to the sales array.
•	calculateTotalSales(): Returns the total sales for the month.
•	calculateAverageDailySales(): Returns the average daily sales.
•	findBestSalesDay(): Returns the day with the highest sales.
•	findWorstSalesDay(): Returns the day with the lowest sales.
•	displaySalesReport(): Displays total sales, average daily sales, best and worst sales days.


Implement error handling mechanisms (e.g., exception handling) in each class to handle scenarios like invalid inputs or insufficient funds.
